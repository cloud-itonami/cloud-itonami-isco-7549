  "CraftNecGovernor — the independent safety/scope layer gating
  every craft workshop scheduling/logistics proposal an advisor may
  make for a craft workshop crew. ISCO-08 7549 (Craft and Related
  Workers Not Elsewhere Classified) is a broad/generic residual
  craft-work category — varied hand-tools, varied materials, no
  single dominant hazard type — so this governor's hazard-escalation
  path stays generic (hand-tool-hazard / material-handling-hazard /
  equipment-condition) rather than gating one dominant
  technique-specific hazard. The governor never dispatches hardware
  itself, never performs craft work itself, and never finalizes a
  craft-execution decision (e.g. deciding a craft item is finished)
  or a product-quality/safety-clearance decision (e.g. declaring an
  item quality- or safety-cleared), nor overrides a shop safety
  officer's judgment — those are permanently out of this actor's
  scope and remain a shop safety officer's exclusive judgment
  (README's 'Robotics premise': this actor coordinates WORKSHOP
  SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS ONLY — it never performs craft work or makes
  quality/safety-clearance decisions itself). Modeled closely on
  cloud-itonami-isco-7319's craftcoord.governor (closest domain
  shape — a published, tested generic workshop scheduling/logistics
  coordination pattern for the sibling residual craft-work
  category).

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. worker provenance      — the crew member must be independently
                                verified/registered before any action.
    2. workshop provenance    — the workshop site must be independently
                                verified/registered before any action.
    3. no-actuation           — proposal :effect must be :propose (the
                                governor never dispatches hardware and
                                never performs craft work itself; it
                                only gates what the advisor may
                                coordinate).
    4. closed op-allowlist    — only :log-work-record,
                                :schedule-crew-operation,
                                :flag-safety-concern and
                                :coordinate-supply-order may ever be
                                proposed; anything else is refused.
    5. scope-excluded action  — any proposal to directly finalize a
                                craft-execution decision (e.g.
                                deciding a craft item is finished) or
                                a product-quality/safety-clearance
                                decision (e.g. declaring an item
                                quality- or safety-cleared), or to
                                override a shop safety officer's
                                judgment, is a hard, permanent block
                                (checked both against the proposed
                                :op and, defense-in-depth, against the
                                proposal's :rationale text — matched
                                as full finalization/execution ACTION
                                phrases such as \"finalize the craft
                                item\" / \"declare the product
                                quality-cleared\" / \"override the
                                shop safety officer's judgment\",
                                never as bare nouns like \"craft\",
                                \"quality\" or \"safety\", so the
                                check can never self-trip on the
                                advisor's own routine rationale text,
                                e.g. \"logged work record for worker
                                …\" or \"scheduled crew operation for
                                craft task …\" or \"…routed for shop
                                safety officer review\" — all three
                                legitimately contain those bare nouns
                                but none is a finalization action, and
                                all are exercised by
                                `governor-test/default-mock-advisor-proposals-never-self-trip-on-scope-exclusion`).
  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off
  regardless of confidence):
